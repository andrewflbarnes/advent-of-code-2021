# advent-of-code-2021

In Rust again! I've used Rust twice since the last AOC
- Synacor challenge
- Partial AOC 2019

Hopefully still have it in me :)

## Running Solutions

Day 1-3 are (for now) in JS. Run them with the corresponding dn.js script e.g. to run day 2
```bash
cd js
node d2.js
```

For all other days run a solution with cargo providing the day number e.g. to run day 4
```bash
cargo run 4
```
